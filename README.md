# Subhan's Portfolio

A 3D interactive portfolio showcasing my projects. The entire scene and all 3D models were created by me using Blender. The project is built with [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Features

- Responsive 3D environment rendered with Three.js
- Custom Blender models baked for web performance
- Smooth animations and scroll-based transitions
- Simple UI for navigating between sections

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Folder Structure

- `public/models` – exported GLB models from the Blender scene
- `src/` – React components and application logic
- `blender/` – source `.blend` file for the scene

## License

This project is released under the MIT License. All models and assets were created by me and are free to use with attribution.
